## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Phantom ray-hair intersector example demonstrating how to extend
the API with a custom curve primitive type.
- CPU-parallel BVH refitter. Refitting is used in juggler example.
- New "juggler" example demonstrating dynamic scenes and procedural
textures.

### Changed
- Switched to Ubuntu 16.04 with Travis-CI. We no longer support
Ubuntu 14.04 and gcc 4.8 as that is too old for pbrtParser.
- pbrtParser is now a submodule instead of an external dependency
supplied by the user.

## [0.1.1] - 2020-06-22
### Fixed
- CUDA LBVH builder based on Karras' construction algorithm now
working. Fixed an index bug where the wrong prim-bounds were used to
expand leaf node bounding boxes.
